# Machine Learning Regression Analysis

## Overview
This project explores **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** using different implementations and optimization techniques. The goal is to analyze and compare multiple regression approaches on synthetic datasets, evaluating their accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
✔️ **Linear Regression:** Implemented using:
   - Scikit-learn’s built-in model  
   - Manual computation using the **pseudoinverse** method  
   - **Gradient Descent** optimization  

✔️ **Polynomial Regression:** Evaluating models of different degrees:
   - Scikit-learn's `PolynomialFeatures` with degrees **1, 3, 5, 7**  
   - Manual implementation using the **pseudoinverse method** (degree 3)  

✔️ **Performance Analysis:**  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for different methods  
   - Comparison of **underfitting vs. overfitting**  
   - Visualizations of regression fits and error convergence
